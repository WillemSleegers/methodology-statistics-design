# SURVEY DESIGNS AND METHODS {-#surveys}

This section will cover specific 'survey' related content, as well as some content that overlaps with experiments and trials.

More technical and involved discussion of overlapping content will often be deferred to the [experiments and trials](#expt_trial) section, with placeholders and links.

## How to ask good survey questions

## Avoiding pitfalls

## Constructing reliable indices and scales

## Sampling issues and representativeness

## Implementation platforms and issues

## Survey design tools (IT)


# EXPERIMENTS AND TRIAL DESIGN {-#expt_trial}

Note that much 'experiment and trial' relevant content is covered in the [surveys](#surveys) section. We will put in placeholders and cross-link.

# Experiment and trial design: qualitative issues and guidelines, implementation issues {#expt-qual-imp}

## Basic design choices and terminology

### Types of experiments: 'lab and field'

##Â Formulating hypotheses and 'learning and adaptation goals'

## Hypothesis testing versus 'reinforcement learning' goals

## Design concerns and pitfalls

### Confounded designs

### Attrition and failed randomization

### 'Demand effects'

### Naturalness versus cleanliness

## Practical and implementation issues

Survey and experiment platforms (see 'surveys') chapter

### Field experiments, A/B and lift tests, and marketing trials

### Designing, coding, and implementing experiments: IT issues

### Failure and success modes

### Capturing outcome data

### Pre-registration and pre-analysis plans

# Experiment and trial design: quantitative issues {#expt-quant}

## 'Treatment' assignment (blocking, randomization, etc)

### Adaptive, sequential and dynamic designs

## Planning, diagnosing and adjusting a design

### Specifying models, hypotheses, and statistical testing and inference approaches

(Just a brief here, this will be covered in more detail in the sections on statistical inference, testing, and analysis

## Power analyses (and other 'diagnosands')

Note: this will very much overlap the discussion of power analysis for *surveys*. Perhaps we put the simpler introduction there, and the more involved details here

### Key resources and explainers

('Curate link' tools we found useful)


### See ['Rethink_Priorities_Power_analysis_framework_2' in  appendix](#power-workflow)

This is a proposal and tools for a 'path to do' power testing (by Jamie Elsey; David Reinstein will weigh in too). I think this first focuses on a frequentist approach, but it's likely to also introduce a Bayesian approach.

DR: I'm putting it into an appendix to the bookdown for now. We may incorporate much of that into the present section.

An alternative to an 'appendix' is a standalone page which we can link here. This can sometimes be helpful; it allows a different format, may save time on knitting, may allow that other page to be better integrated elsewhere.

But for now, I'll make it a bookdown appendix, to help get us all used to the current format and avoid disagregation.
