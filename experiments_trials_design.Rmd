# EXPERIMENTS AND TRIAL DESIGN {-}

# Experiment and trial design: qualitative issues and guidelines, implementation issues {#expt-qual-imp}

## Basic design choices and terminology

### Types of experiments: 'lab and field'

##Â Formulating hypotheses and 'learning and adaptation goals'

## Hypothesis testing versus 'reinforcement learning' goals

## Design concerns and pitfalls

### Confounded designs

### Attrition and failed randomization

### 'Demand effects'

### Naturalness versus cleanliness

## Practical and implementation issues

Survey and experiment platforms (see 'surveys') chapter

### Field experiments, A/B and lift tests, and marketing trials

### Designing, coding, and implementing experiments: IT issues

### Failure and success modes

### Capturing outcome data

### Pre-registration and pre-analysis plans

# Experiment and trial design: quantitative issues {#expt-quant}

## 'Treatment' assignment (blocking, randomization, etc)

### Adaptive, sequential and dynamic designs

## Planning, diagnosing and adjusting a design

### Specifying models, hypotheses, and statistical testing and inference approaches

(Just a brief here, this will be covered in more detail in the sections on statistical inference, testing, and analysis

## Power analyses (and other 'diagnosands')

Note: this will very much overlap the discussion of power analysis for *surveys*
