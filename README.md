Surveys, experiments, data analysis: Methodology, protocols and templates

Proceeding from Slack discussion [here](https://rethinkpriorities.slack.com/archives/G01962YABHB/p1636393408082200)


## 'Methods and RP Guidelines Bookdown' 

### To contain...

See [airtable topic list](https://airtable.com/shrK7Pc0K8JPjmQkN) ... some examples below

**Data and code** 

- Visualizations: suggested/preferred formats and templates
     - Integrate/move content from [ea-data 'presentation and method discussion'](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/ea-data/blob/master/Rmd/presentation_method_discussion.Rmd and some Gdocs and Slack threads

**Experiments, trials and survey design 

- Experiment and trial design: qualitative issues and guidelines
- Power analyses for planning experiments and trials
- Adaptive designs

**Statistical analysis, inference, and prediction tools**

- Psychometrics, especially factor analysis
- Dealing with attrition
- Practical Bayesian approaches
- Monte-Carlo 'Fermi estimation' approaches
- Predictive modeling and machine learning

- Integrate some content/organization from [Reinstein's "Metrics bookdown"](https://daaronr.github.io/metrics_discussion/introduction.html)

### Using and building this Bookdown (proposed guidlines)

- Add stuff to the Bookdown in a concise way, once its readable/useable.
- Non-core material: out-link to standalone pages/gists/blogdowns whatever and/or Bookdown ‘appendix’ sections and folding boxes for the non-core material
- Link to these resources in Guru, but don't repeat this content there.

### Repo branches (proposed)

- ‘main’: Decent looking, go-to
- ‘public’: same as ‘main’ but censoring anything we need to keep in house (build a parsing script for that)
- ‘Working branch’: Work in progress including discussion
