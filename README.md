## 'Methods and RP Guidelines Bookdown'

### To contain...

... *Only* things that we use, have used, want to use, or have been requested to address. To keep this manageable, don't add content just because "it's in a typical syllabus'.

See [airtable topic list](https://airtable.com/shrK7Pc0K8JPjmQkN) ... some examples below

### Proposed structure


Moved to [introduction chapter here](#outline_sections) (file: introduction_overview.Rmd)


### Sources

- Integrate some content/organization from [Reinstein's "Metrics bookdown"](https://daaronr.github.io/metrics_discussion/introduction.html)

- RP Slack threads

- 'Resources' chapters in EA Market testing Gitbook

- Textbooks/online resources:  ...

- Articles: ...

### Using and building this Bookdown (proposed guidelines)

- Add stuff to the Bookdown in a concise way, once it's at least minimally readable/useable. (See distinct branches discussed below).
- For non-core material: out-link to standalone pages/gists/blogdowns whatever and/or Bookdown ‘appendix’ sections and folding boxes for the non-core material
- Link to these resources in Guru, but don't repeat this content there.
- If an ideal guide to 'exactly what we want' exist elsewhere, just 'curate link it', Pete W-style, don't re-write the wheel

*Key links for tips on using 'these tools'*

### Repo branches (proposed)

- ‘main’: Decent looking, go-to
- ‘public’: same as ‘main’ but simplified for public sharing (if we want to)
- ‘work-in-progress’: Work in progress including discussion that you don't want to add to 'main' yet
