# Presentation, labeling and visualisations {#presentation}

```{block2,  type='note'}
Note: this has been moved from a discussion of the EA survey in the ea-data repo, and is being expanded here*
```

## Aside: EA Forum organisation, collophon, formatting



```{block2,  type='fold'}

We often need to make output into a format acceptable for the EA Forum

Typically, RP has made these posts first in Google Docs for feedback and then there is some sort of sprocedure to get it into EA forum markdown syntax from there. For some previous posts, we pasted from the Rstudio visual mode pastes into Google docs for narrative, and figures/tables could be manually pasted. But we want to avoid having to do that!

David Reinstein has worked with Pete and others on tools to (mostly) automate this conversion and hosting process, but some manual tweaks were needed at the end. See the work on this [here, at bottom](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/ea-data/blob/master/main_2020.R), and in [this R script](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/ea-data/blob/master/code/parse_ea_forum_md.R) and [this Python script](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/ea-data/blob/master/code/fix_eafo_links.py).  Yes, spaghetti code.

Atm, some formatting adjustments are necessary, e.g.,  EA Forum doesn't have margin notes or folding boxes.

## Visualisations

See also Gdoc: [visualisation discussions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U_k_sIPDQmkKgatgXStDqrwi-g3vPGgftYbN8AEDPhs/edit#)

### Ideal coding practice for visualisations {-}

Use `ggplot` always unless you've a strong reason to do otherwise. Always save the plot as an object in the environment as well as printing it where it belongs.

Ideally, we will come up with a set of functions and default options for the key sets of plots we use and like.

Define and reuse lists of labels (or use inherent labeling options where these exist, to exploit existing variable and value labels.)

Otherwise define sets of common options for plots in one place, and repeated ggplot elements together as a list:

-   to avoid repetition and clutter

-   to allow easy 'global' adjustment

### Labeling {-}

Use readable but concise labels. "Amount donated" is OK, "GWWC" is OK because we assume people know what GWWC is from context.

`amt_don` is not OK. Pete will yell at you.

Try to have labels be automated ... either using column attributes or a concise list



### Case: Relative shares of a total; e.g. 'shares of EA population by referrer', or 'donation totals by country' {-}

**Treemaps**

```{block2,  type='note'}
NOTE: The below will not run without data, but we cannot make data 'public' here ... we can swap this for built in R or simulated data in this discussion
```

```{r}

geom_treemap_opts <- list(geom_treemap(alpha = 0.7),
  geom_treemap_text(fontface = "italic", colour = "white", place = "centre",
                    grow = TRUE, min.size = 1 ),
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  )

(
  don_share_by_size <- eas_20 %>% select(donation_2019_c, donation_2019_c_split) %>%
  group_by(donation_2019_c_split) %>%
  summarise(total_don = sum(donation_2019_c, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(don_share = round(total_don/sum(total_don)*100)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(donation_2019_c_split)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(area = total_don, fill= donation_2019_c_split,
             # Include percentage of total donation
             label = paste(donation_2019_c_split, paste0(don_share, "%"), sep = "\n"))) +
    geom_treemap_opts +
  ggtitle("Share of total 2019 reported donation amount, by donation size")
)

```

A good alternative to the treemap ... conveying both absolute amounts and rates in the same graph?

### Case: Likert scale (individual items) and relative responses to these {-}


The combination of stacked bar charts and overlayed error/CI bars for some 'middle split' seems informative:


```{r wppage}

knitr::include_url("https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas-engagement.html#summary-charts")

```

Above: from [EAS engagement post, bookdown supplement](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas-engagement.html#summary-charts)



### Issue: Dealing with scales and large differences in magnitudes {-}

If axes are cut and don't go to zero, mention this prominently in the plot.

But what if we have a few values that are way above others, and 'mess up the scale'?

Sometimes a logarithmic scale is helpful, but that can also lead to confusion. Otherwise...

-   "any CI's or other things that go outside of the limits should just be extended to the edge and not dropped)"

    -   doable with scale_y\_continuous( oob = scales::squish) +

        scale_x\_continuous( oob = scales::squish)`` or  `coord_cartesian` ``

-   or otherwise allow a clear 'break' in the axis?

-   Not possible to break the axis ggplot <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7194688/using-ggplot2-can-i-insert-a-break-in-the-axis>

-   @Oska -- what about 'extending to the edge'?

Remove outliers as a last resort; prominently mention this where doing so.

### Case: Means of continuous variables: differences across groups {-}

Some (imperfect) examples from donation post:

![](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/ea_survey_work_files/figure-html/planned_actual_gwwc-1.png)

- Vertical lines for 'medians and means' help put this in context


### Case: Categorical outcomes by continuous outcomes (and vice/versa) {-}


```{r wppage}

knitr::include_url("https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas-engagement.html#engagement-by-age-and-tenure")

```

Above, from the [EAS engagement post bookdown](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas-engagement.html#engagement-by-age-and-tenure), we combine a `geom_point` with a `geom_smooth`.\*

<div class="marginnote">
\* DR: I'm slightly concerned about misinterpretations of the smoothed thing though ... those shaded regions maybe should not be interpreted as CI?
</div>

Here, I think the use of `%>% ggplotly` yields only one helpful feature (but its very helpful): hovering over a dot or point on the line brings up an exact value label. I think this helps a reader understand 'what the heck this is'.


### Case: Visualizing (regression) model coefficients and confidence intervals {-}

Forest plots as seen [in donation post here](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas_donations.html#predictive-models)

![](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/ea_survey_work_files/figure-html/fp_demog_coefs_qp-1.png)

Our `group_fp_do` function makes this easy to do.

See how we group the coefficients into plots  by 'theme'

\

In some contexts, lines for 'base rates' can be helpful
