## Rethink Priorities: Our approach to empirical and quantitative work

## The purpose of this resource

(integrate discussion from Slack thread and readme)

## Sections and organization {#outline_sections}
(Proposed/discussedbelow -- keep updated with actual structure)

**[DATA, CODE](#data)** \*

<div class="marginnote">

\* Note that the capital letters denote the highest-level sections, but in the markdown these are at the same level as the sections below
</div>

**Coding practice and tools**

(Languages, clean code, reproducability, etc.)

**Data practices** 

(Storing, labeling, etc)

**[PRESENTING AND DESCRIBING DATA](#present)**

- Methods of 'describing data'

- Formatting: tables, figures, and numerical content**

- Visualizations: suggested/preferred formats and templates
     

**SURVEY DESIGNS AND METHODS**

- How to ask good survey questions

- Avoiding pitfalls

- Sampling issues and representativeness

- Constructing reliable indices and scales

- Implementation platforms and issues

- Survey design tools (IT)

**EXPERIMENTS AND TRIALS*

- [Experiment and trial design: qualitative issues and guidelines](#expt-qual-imp)

- [Experiment and trial design: quantitative issues](#expt-quant)

- 'Treatment' assignment (blocking, randomization, etc)
- Adaptive, sequential and dynamic designs
- Planning, diagnosing and adjusting a design
- Power analyses (and other 'diagnosands')


**BASIC STATISTICS: MODELING, TESTING AND INFERENCE**

- Bayesian, frequentist, and other approaches

- A 'statistical model'\*

<div class="marginnote">
\* I put in the first discussion of 'models' here because, at least in one perspective, all of the below is based on models.
</div>

- Bayesian updating and inference
- Hypothesis testing
- Preferred approaches ('which tests') etc.

**[MODELING, PREDICTION, INFERENCE, AND MACHINE LEARNING](#modeling)**

- "Multi-variable 'regression' models" and specification choices
- Interpreting model results
- Predictive modeling and machine learning
- Practical Bayesian approaches and interpretations
- Psychometrics, especially factor analysis

**[CAUSAL INFERENCE](#causal)**

- Basic ideas and frameworks (simple, potential outcomes, DAGs)
- Pitfalls and mistakes (layman's terms)
- The experimental ideal
- Non-experimental approaches to causal inference
- Dealing with attrition

**[MONTE-CARLO 'FERMI ESTIMATION' APPROACHES](#fermi);**

- The basic ideas
- Causal and Guesstimate
- Code-based tools
